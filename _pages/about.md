I am a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University in the Robotics Institute (RI) co-advised by [Jean Oh](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/jean-hyaejin-oh/) and [Jeffrey Ichnowski](https://ichnow.ski/). I also work as a research scientist intern with robot learning group at Bosch AI (Summer 2025) and Meta (Fall 2025). As a member of RI's [BIG lab](https://cmubig.github.io/) and Momentum lab, my research focuses on **reasoning about and leveraging deformation in contact-rich robotic manipulation tasks**.

My work spans two main areas: developing methods to utilize robot compliance for dexterous and delicate manipulation, and reasoning about continuous deformations of soft objects during contact-rich interactions. This research combines theoretical foundations in discrete differential geometry, machine learning, and soft body mechanics with practical applications in deploying dexterous robots to the real world.

I received my B.Sc. in Mathematics (2020) and in Mechanical Engineering (2021) at the University of Texas at Austin, where I developed my interest in continuous deformations and continuum structure representation. My research is supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program.
