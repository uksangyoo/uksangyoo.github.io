I am a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University in the Robotics Institute (RI) co-advised by [Jean Oh](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/jean-hyaejin-oh/) and [Jeffrey Ichnowski](https://ichnow.ski/). I am a member of RI's [BIG lab](https://cmubig.github.io/) and Momentum lab.  I am broadly interested in perceiving deformation of the manipulated objects or the robot and learning to cause deformations. Specifically, I have worked on developing methods to leverage the compliance of deformable robots and reason about contact for dexterous and delicate manipulation tasks. Additionally, I work on reasoning about continuous deformations of soft/deformable objects in contact-rich manipulation tasks. You can reach me at my email: uyoo at cs.cmu.edu.

I received my B.Sc. in Mathematics (2020) and in Mechanical Engineering (2021) at the University of Texas at Austin, where I was inspired to study continuous deformations and representation of continuum structures with both theoretical and practical approaches. I am honored to be supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowships Program.
